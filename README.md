While setting up my React Native app, I began by installing Expo and then created a new project using expo init. I opened the project in my code editor and customized the App.js file by adding several <Text> elements to display my name, the module title, and task details. I also applied basic styling to adjust the background color and font sizes.
The trickiest part was centering the text on the screen. Initially, I tried using alignItems within the Text styles, but it didnâ€™t have any effect. I later discovered that alignItems only works with View components. To fix it, I switched to using textAlign: 'center', which successfully centered the text. After that, everything looked just right.
